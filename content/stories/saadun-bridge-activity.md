*"I can't change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination."* **Jimmy Dean**

This is a concept that Meng was built on and we live by it every day. We can't change the whole world at once but we can control our actions. Having the right goals in mind, and pushing towards those goals one step at a time is the key for a sustainable development in the community. It all started when one of our first volunteers saw something wrong with the world and decided to do something about it. An idea to clean a public place, Saadun bridge, grew to attract several volunteers who loved it so much they wanted to do those activities regularly.

After the official announcement of Meng, we decided to go back to the origin of our organization and leave our first touches on our beautiful city. We went to Saadun bridge and added a visual flavor to the scene. We cleaned the bridge, painted on the walls and added some inspirational messages on them. We also hanged decorative flower pots on the fence of the bridge.

We believe in our community and we believe in the potential of the youth. Good deeds, no matter how small, will propagate and affect the lives and actions of every person who sees them in positive ways. As it is clear from the pictures, we tried our best to do our activities after working hours, when this area becomes more crowded. This allowed us to display our work and to show people that just as we, young volunteers with no funding, can make such a change in the city, so can they.
