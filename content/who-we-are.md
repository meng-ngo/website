We are a group of young people who graduated from university and decided to make their city a better place.

## WHAT INSPIRED US

Being in a region that is far from being stable, our post university lives weren't at all what we expected. Most of us finished school in 2014 - 2015, the years terrorism was tearing through the region. Big companies left, and our economy fell. We saw people suffering, starving, and everything was falling apart. Looking at that situation we realized that to fix the society, we had to start with ourselves. As we started doing those activities, we realized that we had to spread our passion to other people. We decided to combine our experiences and passion and form this organization and try to reach and impact the lives of as many people as we can.

## OUR TEAM

What started with two people, gradually grew into a team of 8 people. We are young, energetic, and self motivated people who try to adapt to the society needs. Most of us are recent graduates who joined the team to have a positive impact on the people around us.

## WHAT WE DO

Our activities cover a wide range of areas, those include:

### Career Development

We hold CV writing and career mentoring workshops to help university students in their transition to the industry. CV writing is an undervalued skill. It is essential to craft a good quality CV that will WOW the recruiters. Most students graduate with no knowledge in this topic and struggle in getting interviews. There is a big gap between what people learn at school and what's actually waiting for them when they try to get a job. Our mission is to close that gap by sharing our experiences in finding our dream jobs.

### Environmental Awareness

We go out on the streets of the city or the suburbs during or after major events and try to target issues with the environment. Global warming, littering, and the lack of awareness are major problems in our cities. We can't depend on the government to keep every street clean and make our world greener. We have to act ourselves. Every person we inspire not to liter the planet will in turn impact people around them.

### Society Development

Our aim is to be a beacon of positive energy in our society. We try to broadcast positive messages through social media and mural paintings. Positivity brings happiness. Happiness motivates people to be the better version of themselves. This in turn will create more positivity, less hate, and inspire others to broadcast this message and help us reach everyone in the city.
